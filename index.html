        <p>Once-in-a-lifetime films are pipe dreams for most studios, yet, here’s Marvel showing off the fact that they have us all in the palm of their hands yet again. Spider-Man: No Way Home is somehow a perfect harmony of a Saturday morning cartoon and the deep drama that we’ve come to expect from these epics. You’ll find no spoilers here, but the film will remind you repeatedly that there are a whole lot of reasons that Sony and Marvel kept the details of this one as close to the vest as possible.

Despite the fact that there’s so much we can’t talk about here, we can still find plenty of tidbits to discuss, because there’s truly never a dull moment in Spider-Man: No Way Home. That’s due in no small part to stellar performances across the board. The MCU as a whole has never been a slouch when it comes to casting. Some of the best actors in the world now hold their own respective Marvel roles. But, whether it be the pandemic or No Way Home's lack of buildup from other installments in the MCU, the performances here feel like something different. Willem Dafoe nails everything he does, but his reprisal of Norman Osborn is something for the MCU history books. His character — like the rest of the villains who find their way into Peter’s (Tom Holland) universe — is given a new depth that was never explored in previous Spider-Man films.</p>

I knew from the start that it was no ordinary day, but I certainly didn't expect to find a golden staircase in my attic. Up at the top, there was a door. And beyond the door was a world I never could have imagined -- the Kingdom of Fantasy! Along with my guide, a frog named Scribblehopper, I set off on an incredible adventure to save the Queen of the Fairies. But along the way, I had to face giant scorpions, witches, sea serpents, pixies, and dozens of other creatures that I had only ever heard stories about. Holey cheese, what a journey! Could I save the Queen . . . and my own tail?</p>

        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Saudi officials announced they’re building a zero-carbon city where 1 million residents will live among nature — with no cars, no streets, and no carbon emissions.

Construction for the brand-new city, called The Line, starts early this year along the Red Sea coast. Construction will preserve 95 percent of nature in the region where it’s being built.
        The city will have three layers: The surface layer is for pedestrians, where residents will have access to all their daily needs within a five-minute walking radius. The second layer is underground and exists for infrastructure. The lowest layer, also underground, contains ultra-high speed transit, which will connect residents with other communities.

“It is a new era of civilization, a new model for a city which is clean, proper, and with zero carbon,” Saudi economist Mazen Al-Sudairi told Arab News. “This will improve the efficiency of humankind.”

The innovative venture offers inspiration to think outside the box and push the limits of what’s been possible in city planning. The green, technology-driven infrastructure plan offers a new vision for the future.</p>

        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Plastics made from fossil fuels are just over a century old. Production and development of thousands of new plastic products accelerated after World War II, so transforming the modern age that life without plastics would be unrecognizable today. Plastics revolutionized medicine with life-saving devices, made space travel possible, lightened cars and jets—saving fuel and pollution—and saved lives with helmets, incubators, and equipment for clean drinking water.

The conveniences plastics offer, however, led to a throw-away culture that reveals the material’s dark side: today, single-use plastics account for 40 percent of the plastic produced every year. Many of these products, such as plastic bags and food wrappers, have a lifespan of mere minutes to hours, yet they may persist in the environment for hundreds of years.</p>
